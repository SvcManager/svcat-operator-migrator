# svcat-operator-migrator

## Prerequisite
1. Prepare your platform for migration by executing: </br>
```smctl curl -X PUT  -d '{"sourcePlatformID": ":platformID"}' /v1/migrate/service_operator/:instanceID``` </br>
**instanceID**: instance of service-manager/service-operator-access
2. Install [sap btp service operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator#setup) by providing clusterID the same as of SVCAT 

***Note: you can delete the old platform after successful migration***

## Getting started

To use the migration CLI you need to download and install it first:

### Approach 1: Manual installation

#### Download CLI
``go get github.com/SvcManager/svcat-operator-migrator``

#### Install CLI

``go install github.com/SvcManager/svcat-operator-migrator``

#### Rename the CLI binary

``mv $GOPATH/bin/svcat-operator-migrator $GOPATH/bin/migrate``

### Approach 2: Get the latest CLI release
You can get started with the CLI by simply downloading the latest release from [HERE](https://github.com/SvcManager/svcat-operator-migrator/releases).

  dry-run     Run migration in dry run mode
  help        Help about any command
  run         Run migration process
  version     Prints migrate version

Flags:
  -c, --config string       config file (default is $HOME/.migrate/config.json)
  -h, --help                help for migrate
  -k, --kubeconfig string   absolute path to the kubeconfig file (default $HOME/.kube/config)
  -n, --namespace string    namespace to find operator secret (default sap-btp-operator)
```

## Example usage of CLI:

```sh
# Run migration including pre migration validations
migrate run

*** Fetched 1 bindings from SM
*** Fetched 5 svcat instances from cluster
*** Fetched 2 svcat bindings from cluster
*** Fetched 14 operator instances from cluster
*** Fetched 3 operator bindings from cluster
*** Preparing resources
